Bugs:
Display correct size for symlinks
Rename file correctly if another one with the same name already exists
Add fixed width to icons
Firefox:
Warns about empty attributes "type" and "source" of a video tag
Requires video tag to have a "type" attribute
IsFullscreen function works only in Chrome
Windows:
As a result of the bug with symlinks, symlinks are treated as octet/stream and not as directories

Fixed:
Fullscreen videos still have some bugs, such as not closing properly

Future work:
Different icon for forbidden directories
Sorting, mime-based sorting?
Locally generated QR codes
Image Viewer
Music Player
Maybe API-based web application? (a way to not close the video while browsing around)
Speedometer?
