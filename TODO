Bugs:
Display correct size for symlinks
Finish work on extensions, specifically, remove the call to printer.Note
Windows:
As a result of the bug with symlinks, symlinks are treated as octet/stream and not as directories
Fixed:
Fullscreen videos still have some bugs, such as not closing properly

Future work:
Different icon for forbidden directories
Sorting, mime-based sorting?
Image Viewer
Music Player
Maybe API-based web application? (a way to not close the video while browsing around)
Speedometer?
