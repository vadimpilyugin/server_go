Bugs:
Display correct size for symlinks
Fullscreen videos still have some bugs, such as not closing properly
Finish work on extensions, specifically, remove the call to printer.Note

Future work:
Sorting, mime-based sorting?
Image Viewer
Music Player
Maybe API-based web application? (a way to not close the video while browsing around)
Speedometer?
